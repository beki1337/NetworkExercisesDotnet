# Network Programming Exercises in C#

This repository contains a set of exercises for network programming using C# and the `NetworkExercisesDotnet` library. These exercises cover various aspects of network programming, including establishing connections, handling exceptions, working with network streams, and more.

## Exercises

1. **EstablishConnectionWithTcpClient**: In this exercise, you'll learn how to establish a connection to a target server using the provided `ITcpClient` interface. You will use the `Connect` methods to connect to a server of your choice.

2. **EstablishConnectionWithTcpClientException**: This exercise focuses on handling exceptions, specifically `SocketException`, which is thrown when a connection is refused. You will use a try/catch block to catch and handle this specific exception.

3. **GetNetworkStream**: Learn how to retrieve a network stream from an `ITcpClient` object that has already established a connection. You'll use the `GetStream` method to get an `INetworkStream` object.

4. **ReadfromStrem**: In this exercise, you'll utilize the `Read` method of the `INetworkStream` to read data from the stream and return it as a string.

5. **WriteToStream**: Learn how to use the `Write` method of the `INetworkStream` to send data to the stream.

6. **StartListing**: Understand how to listen for incoming TCP connections using the `ITcpListener` object's `Start` method.

7. **AcceptClinets**: This exercise involves accepting incoming TCP connections and returning the `ITcpClient` object that is retrieved from the `AcceptTcpClient` method.

8. **CloseTcpListern**: Learn how to close the TCP listener using the `Stop` method of the `ITcpListener` object.

9. **ReadFromClosedConnection**: In this exercise, you'll handle the scenario where the other computer has closed the connection, leading to a `SocketException` when you attempt to read from the stream.

## Getting Started

To get started with the exercises, simply clone this repository and open the project in your preferred C# development environment. Run the tests to assert and complete the exercises. Make sure to follow the instructions and comments in the code for each exercise.

```csharp
// Example usage of an exercise
NetworkExercises.EstablishConnectionWithTcpClient(tcpClient);
